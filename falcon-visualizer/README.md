# Falcon Visualizer

Falcon Visualizer provides a space-time diagram of a distributed system's execution with the goal of easing the analysis of runtime behavior. The diagram organizes the events executed into per-process timelines and also depicts the inter-process causal relationships.

Falcon Visualizer is built on top of [vuejs](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/).

## Installation 

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# (alternative) build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Usage

1. After the server starts, the browser should automatically open at `http://localhost:8080`. 
2. Click the button *Choose File* and select the event trace generated by **falcon-solver**.  
3. Click the button *Tick* to start drawing the diagram. By systematically clicking the button (or pressing the space bar), new logical timestamps will appear on the left side of the screen and the events occurring at those timestamps will be drawn along with their causal dependencies.
