# Falcon Solver

Falcon Solver uses symbolic constraint solving to order a set of distributed events according to their *happens-before* relationship [1]. There exists a happens-before relationship between two events **A** and **B** if **A** causally precedes **B**. Any two events **A'** and **B'** that are not ordered by a happens-before dependency are said to be *concurrent*. 

In more detail, Falcon Solver:
1. Receives an input file with a set of events in JSON format;
2. Builds an SMT constraint model that contains symbolic variables representing the events' logical clocks and constraints encoding the happens-before relationships between them;
3. Solves the constraint model to obtain the logical clocks for the events that satisfy the causal dependencies.

## Requirements
- Install [Z3 Theorem Prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) (make sure that the `z3` binary is in the environment PATH `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`)
- Install *falcon-taz*: `cd ../falcon-taz ; mvn package install`

## Installation

- Compile *falcon-solver*: 
```bash
mvn package
```

## Usage

(Assuming `$HOME=<path/to/falcon-solver>`)
- Run: `java -jar $HOME/target/falcon-solver-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar [options]`

The options available are:

* `--event-file <path-to-event-file>` indicates the path to the event trace in JSON format. **[required]**
* `--use-timestamp <true/false>` is a boolean flag indicating whether Falcon should solve the constraints attempting to follow the original event timestamps. If false, Falcon will solve the model attempting to minimize the logical clocks. Default: `true`.
* `--solver-bin <path-to-solver-bin>` indicates the path to the Z3 solver binary. Default: `z3`.
* `--output-file <path-to-output-file>` indicates the path to the output file produced by Falcon Solver. The output file contains the set of events in JSON format ordered by their causal order. Default: `trace-ordered.out`.

Alternatively, these parameters can be configured by editing the file `$HOME/src/main/resources/causalSolver.properties` prior to building the jar.
